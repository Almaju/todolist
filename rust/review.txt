Review:
I cannot review the code provided as it is incomplete. Please include the content of the `in_memory_store` module for a thorough review.

File: ./src/lib.rs
Review:
The code appears to be missing the closing curly brace for the module declaration. It should be:
```
pub mod application;
mod domain;
mod infrastructure;
```
Aside from this, the code looks fine.

File: ./src/domain.rs
Review:
The code seems to be importing modules and re-exporting their contents.

There are no apparent errors or improvements in this code snippet.

File: ./src/infrastructure/in_memory_store.rs
Review:
There are no errors in the code. The code could be improved by using `expect` instead of `unwrap` to handle potential locking errors.

File: ./src/domain/todolist.rs
Review:
The code is mostly correct, but there are a few improvements that can be made:

1. The `#[derive(Serialize)]` attribute is missing for the `Task` struct. Add it to make the struct serializable.

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct Task {
    name: String,
    done: bool,
}
```

2. In the `handle` method of the `TodoList` struct, consider returning an enum `Result` instead of `Result<Vec<Event>, ()>`. This can provide more descriptive error information, if needed.

```rust
pub fn handle(&self, command: Command) -> Result<Vec<Event>, TodoListError> {
    match command {
        Command::AddTask { name } => Ok(vec![Event::TaskAdded { name }]),
        Command::CompleteTask { index } => Ok(vec![Event::TaskCompleted { index }]),
    }
}
```

3. In the `apply` method of the `TodoList` struct, explicitly iterate over the events using `iter()` to avoid consuming the vector unnecessarily.

```rust
pub fn apply(&mut self, events: Vec<Event>) -> &Self {
    for event in events.iter() {
        match event {
            Event::TaskAdded { name } => {
                self.tasks.push(Task { name: name.clone(), done: false });
            }
            Event::TaskCompleted { index } => {
                self.tasks[*index].done = true;
            }
        }
    }
    self
}
```

4. Instead of consuming the `events` vector in the `apply` method, consider using a borrowed reference to the vector since you are only iterating over it.

```rust
pub fn apply(&mut self, events: &[Event]) -> &Self {
    for event in events {
        match event {
            Event::TaskAdded { name } => {
                self.tasks.push(Task { name: name.clone(), done: false });
            }
            Event::TaskCompleted { index } => {
                self.tasks[*index].done = true;
            }
        }
    }
    self
}
```

5. Consider adding an error type, `TodoListError`, to the code and use it in the `Result` types in the `handle` method.

```rust
pub enum TodoListError {
    // Add specific error variants if needed
}
```

Other than these suggestions, the code looks good.

File: ./src/domain/services.rs
Review:
There don't appear to be any errors or improvements in the code. It looks correct and follows common conventions.

File: ./src/domain/use_cases.rs
Review:
Seems like a simple implementation of a `AddTask` struct with a corresponding `handle` method. Here are a few improvements I suggest:

1. Provide more specific error types: The current `Result<(), ()>` doesn't provide meaningful error information. Consider using specific error types that indicate the reason for failure.

2. Remove unnecessary type annotation: The type annotation on `todolist` in `let todolist = self.todolist.get().await;` can be removed since it can be inferred from the return type of `get()`.

3. Use a more descriptive name for the `name` field: Instead of `name: "task".to_string()`, consider using a more meaningful name or optionally parameterize it to accept dynamic task names.

4. Optionally add error handling for `get()` and `save()`: Currently, if `get()` or `save()` returns an error, it is not being handled. Consider adding error handling code or propagate the error to the caller.

5. Consider using `Result` for `handle()` return type: If `handle()` can fail, consider using `Result` instead of returning `Ok(())`.

File: ./src/application.rs
Review:
- The `pub struct Application` should have a `#[derive(Clone)]` attribute to automatically generate the `Clone` trait implementation.
- The `Application` struct is exposed as a WebAssembly binding, so it should implement the `Default` trait to allow creation of default instances.
- The `get_todolist` function should return a `Result<JsValue, JsValue>` instead of just a `JsValue`, to handle potential errors in the `TodoListStore::get` method.
- In the `add_task` function, the `AddTask` struct is created but not used. It should be assigned to a variable or passed directly to the `handle` method.
- The `add_task` function should also return a `Result<(), JsValue>` instead of just `()`, to handle potential errors from the `handle` method.
- In the `TodoListStore` implementation for `InMemoryStore`, the `fn get(&self)` method has the same name as the `fn get(&self)` method in the `TodoListStore` trait. It should be renamed to avoid confusion, for example `fn get_events(&self)`.
- In the `TodoListStore` implementation for `InMemoryStore`, the `fn save(&self, events: Vec<TodoListEvent>)` method is missing an implementation. It should be implemented to actually save the events to the store.
- The `self.save(value)` line in the `TodoListStore` implementation for `InMemoryStore` should use `await` since it's an async method, like this: `self.save(value).await;`.
- The `self.get()` line in the `TodoListStore` implementation for `InMemoryStore` should use `await` since it's an async method, like this: `self.get().await`.
- The `TodoListStore` trait should define the return type of the `save` method as `Result<(), Error>` instead of just `()`, to handle potential errors when saving events.
